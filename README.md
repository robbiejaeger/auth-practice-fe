# Auth Practice - Front End

This repo is used for practice implementing authentication with a third-party library, in this case Auth0.

The corresponding back-end repo is [here](https://github.com/robbiejaeger/auth-practice-be).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
